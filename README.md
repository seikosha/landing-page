# Landing Page Project

## Table of Contents

* what I have done
  * I built the 4 sections button navbar, which can smoothly scroll to the various sections with mouse-click
  * I add active class when scroll to the viewport
* what confused me
  * my navbar-links, although working when you scroll to the top of the whole page, but cannot be clicked when scroll down to any section. I thought it is a bug, however, I researched it a lot but still cannot figure it out by myself. I hope I can hear some advices from the reviewer. Thanks a lot.
